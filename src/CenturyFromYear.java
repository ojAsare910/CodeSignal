/*
    Given a year, return the century it is in. The first century spans from the year 1 up to
    and including the year 100, the second - from the year 101 up to and including the year 200, etc.

    Example

    For year = 1905, the output should be
    solution(year) = 20;
    For year = 1700, the output should be
    solution(year) = 17.
